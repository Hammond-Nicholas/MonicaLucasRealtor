        <h4>Determine the "Musts" and "Wants"</h4>
        <p class="paragraph">Finding the perfect home can seem impossible.  Finding the near-perfect home is much more manageable.  Determine which things you are willing to compromise on and which ones will be deal-breakers.  Foregoing the short commute may allow you to get the house with the extra bedroom.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Spend some time visiting areas you would consider for your new home.  There are several things you may notice that could make a significant impact to your lifestyle in that area.  Some positive things could be schools, parks, shopping centers, and public transporation; while some negative things could be industrial plants, cattle farms, large airports, or congested roadways.</p>

        <h4>Get an Appraisal</h4>
        <p class="paragraph">First things first: get your home appraised.  Websites like Zillow can give you an idea of about how much your home is worth, but the current market value could be significantly different.  Getting an appriasal will let you know what the actual value is and what you can list it for.</p>

        <h4>List your Home</h4>
        <p class="paragraph">The sooner you list your home, the sooner potential buyers will start looking at it.  Depending on the market, your home could go days, weeks, months, or even longer before it sells.  Put it out on the market early.</p>

        <h4>Be as Competitive as the Market Allows</h4>
        <p class="paragraph">Everyone wants to get top-dollar for their home.  Depending on the market, you may be able to ask for more or less than the appraised value.  If you are confident that the home will sell, ask for more.  If you are hoping to sell quicker, it may be prudent to ask for less.</p>
