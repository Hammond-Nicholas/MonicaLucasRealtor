        <h4>Jaime Fairman</h4>
        <p class="paragraph testimonial">"Monica is a true pro! I can't say enough about how perfectly the entire process went with selling our home. She was very involved every step of the way and helped to keep us on track with anything pending action from ourselves to keep the process moving. Her input during the initial walk through in our home and the advice she gave in terms of what to pack up and what to leave behind for preparing our home for staging is what I believe led to us selling very quickly for top dollar. After reviewing the listing she created for us, we started to think we were crazy for selling because our home looked so incredibly beautiful. We had 9 offers, 3 of which were cash offers within 4 days of listing, closed in less than 3 weeks and had zero problems along the way. Everyone she was associated with from the professional photographer to the title company did an excellent job. I'd recommend Monica to my own mother. Not only was she exceptionally professional, she was a true joy to be around. "</p>

        <p class="paragraph testimonial">"My experience with Monica as a realtor was very professional, she worked very fast to help me get in contact with one of her partners to get me qualified, get my loan and the closing. Monica is very knowledgeable and I surely recommend her as your next realtor to sell or buy a house."</p>
